> [!Defintion] Definition
> Computers connected together in peer-to-peer networks do not have any central, or special, authorityâ€”they're all peers, meaning that when it comes to authority, they're all equals. The authority to perform a security check for proper access rights lies with the computer that has the desired resource being requested from it.

It also means that the computers coexisting in a peer-to-peer network can be client machines that access resources and server machines and provide those resources to other computers.

	- security not centrally governed
	- each and every user has to remember and maintain a list of users and passwords on each and every maching
		- gets worse when the passwords for the same users change on different machines!
