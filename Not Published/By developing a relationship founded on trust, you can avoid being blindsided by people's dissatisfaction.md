To foster a relationship of trust and care, the following statements need to be true:

- People should feel that they can share their mistakes, challenges, and fears with you - they should share the biggest challenges to you
	- [[Base respect on the person, not on performance]]
- Giving critical feedback should be the norm, not the exception
- People would want to work for me again
