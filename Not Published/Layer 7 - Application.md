## Overview


> [!Definition] Definition
> The application layer (layer 7) is the highest layer of the communication process. It is the layer that provides the user interface to the user and often the beginning of the communication process. In simple terms, the function of the application layer is to take requests and data from the users and pass them to the lower layers of the OSI model. Incoming information is passed to the application layer, which then displays the information to the users. Some of the most basic application layer services include file and print capabilities.


The most common misconception about the application layer is that it represents applications used on a system, such as a web browser, word processor, or spreadsheet. Instead, the application layer defines the processes that enable applications to use network services. For example, if an application needs to open a file from a network drive, the functionality is provided by components that reside at the application layer. 

A request for information is started at the application layer through three methods:

- graphical user interface (GUI)
- console application
- application programming interface ([[API]])

Many events begin at the application layer:

- sending email
- remote access
- web surfing
- file transfer
- instant messenger
- VoIP calls
