> [!Definition] Definition
> WAN networks are what we use to span large geographic areas and truly go the distance. Like the Internet, WANs usually employ both routers and public links, so that's generally the criteria used to define them.

## Differences to [[LAN - Local Area Network|LANs]]

- WANs usually need a router port or ports.
- WANs span larger geographic areas and/or can link disparate locations.
- WANs are usually slower.
- We can choose when and how long we connect to a WAN. A LAN is all or nothingâ€”our workstation is connected to it either permanently or not at all, although most of us have dedicated WAN links now.
- WANs can utilize either private or public data transport media such as phone lines.

## Multiprotocol Label Switching (MLPS)

will define the actual layout of what is one of the most popular WAN protocols in use today. MPLS has become one of the most innovative and flexible networking technologies on the market, and it has some key advantages over other WAN technologies:

- Physical layout flexibility
- Prioritizing of data
- Redundancy in case of link failure
- One-to-many connection
