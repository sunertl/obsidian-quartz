> [!Definition] Definition
> Computers are connected to a central point with their own individual cables or wireless connections. You'll often find that central spot inhabited by a device like a hub, a switch or an access point. 


## Overview

- Each computer or network segment is connected to the central device individually which means that if the cable fails, it only brings down the machine or network segment related to the point of failure. 
--> network is much more fault tolerant as well as a lot easier to troubleshoot

- It's also a lot more scalable - all you have to do if you want to add to it is run a new cable and connect to the machine at the core of the star.

**Disadvantages** include
- installation cost can be higher because of the larger number of cables, even though prices are becoming more competitive
- it has a single point of failure - the hub or the central device
