I'm Stefan. I am an IT security professional and jaded social scientist.

Thanks for visiting my [[A digital garden consists of ideas that grow over time|digital garden]]. 

I created this site to share some of my (thousand?) notes I wrote over the last couple of years in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a simple, yet powerful note-taking app based on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). 

I extensively used Obsidian for various study projects - search for [[content/notes/AWS|AWS]]
