I’m Stefan. I work in IT security & compliance and I created this [[Networked Thought|website]] to publish my notes on various subjects and interests. Check out my [[map]] to start exploring.




I created this site to share some of my (thousand?) notes I wrote over the last couple of years in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a simple, yet powerful note-taking app based on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

I extensively used Obsidian for various study projects - search for [[content/wiki/aws/index]]

what I am currently working on:

- [[Projects]]

This type of website is often referred to as a *digital garden*, a place that consists of ideas that grow over time - it's a reflection of what one has been, done, and learnt.

Welcome.
