This is a test.

I’m Stefan. I am an IT security professional and jaded social scientist.

Thanks for visiting my [digital garden](https://stefun.io/notes/A-digital-garden-consists-of-ideas-that-grow-over-time).

I created this site to share some of my (thousand?) notes I wrote over the last couple of years in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a simple, yet powerful note-taking app based on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

I extensively used Obsidian for various study projects - search for [[AWS]]
