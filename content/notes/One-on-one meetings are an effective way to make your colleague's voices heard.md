#career/management #incubating 

1:1 meetings should be focused on your report and what would help them be more successful, not on you and what you need.

The ideal 1:1 leaves your report feeling that it was useful for them. 

Remember: [[A manager's role is improve the purpose, people and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can]]

## Guidelines

- Discuss top priorities
- Calibrate what "great" looks like
- Share feedback
	- [[Effective feedback inspires you to change your behavior]]
- Reflect on how things are going
