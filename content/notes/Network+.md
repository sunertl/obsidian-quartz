## Motivation

I realized that I had a massive knowledge gap with networking concepts while studying for the [[AWS Security Speciality]] exam. Fascinated by InfoSec - wanted to get more exposure to basic InfoSec concepts - networking knowledge is absolute key for InfoSec.

## Journey

### Study Log

Goal is to go through one subdomain per day, that means 25 subdomains over 5 domains - potentially done with going through the material (excluding weekends/public holidays for a buffer in case of other priorities/long workdays, etc.) on March 25!
