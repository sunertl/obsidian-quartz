- I discovered that living the life we want requires not only doing the right things; it also requires we stop doing the wrong things that take us off track. 
- Even when we think we’re seeking pleasure, we’re actually driven by the desire to free ourselves from the pain of wanting.  
- Simply put, the drive to relieve discomfort is the root cause of all our behavior, while everything else is a proximate cause.  
- The distractions in our lives are the result of the same forces—they are proximate causes that we think are to blame, while the root causes stay hidden. We tend to blame things like television, junk food, social media, cigarettes, and video games—but these are all proximate causes of our distraction.  
- Solely blaming a smartphone for causing distraction is just as flawed as blaming a pedometer for making someone climb too many stairs. 
- Unless we deal with the root causes of our distraction, we’ll continue to find ways to distract ourselves. Distraction, it turns out, isn’t about the distraction itself; rather, it’s about how we respond to it. 
- Most people don’t want to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth that distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality.  
- Only by understanding our pain can we begin to control it and find better ways to deal with negative urges.  
- Understand the root cause of distraction. Distraction is about more than your devices. Separate proximate causes from the root cause.  
- All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort. If a behavior was previously effective at providing relief, we’re likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort.  
- Anything that stops discomfort is potentially addictive, but that doesn’t make it irresistible. If you know the drivers of your behavior, you can take steps to manage them.  
- As is the case with all human behavior, distraction is just another way our brains attempt to deal with pain. If we accept this fact, it makes sense that the only way to handle distraction is by learning to handle discomfort.  
- If distraction costs us time, then time management is pain management.
