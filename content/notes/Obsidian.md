I've been using Obsidian for more than two years now, initially as a tool to jot down notes while studying for [[content/wiki/aws/index]] exams. I'm still heavily relying on the tool's ability to help me learn more effectively and efficiently and structure my knowledge, however, I am also using it as my own personal wiki. I recognize that there are conceptually similarities between using Obsidian as a knowledge base for studying and creating a personal wiki.

My take on that is that the approach of creating a personal wiki is 

[[Standardization relieves us from the burden of choice]]

[[By dumping tasks into an external system and out of your mind, you can focus on more important aspects of work]]


## Folders

- limited use of folders, but necessity for publishing

## Tags

- plurals
- MOC / HON always written out, nested tags can be abbreviated


## Properties / Metadata

- tags in the actual note
	- create a line at the bottom for tags/references so it doesn't disturb the flow of reading/not getting distracted when seeing the note for the first time
		- HA! Not great doing it like that - when you enable backlinks in the note itself, it creates a line separator below the tags
- metadata in properties - I guess Obsidian Publish will add the ability to read YAML
	- hopefully will safe me some time in the future
