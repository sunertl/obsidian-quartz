## Overview

>[!definition] Defintion
>With AWS IAM Identity Center, you can manage sign-in security for your _workforce identities_, also known as workforce users. IAM Identity Center provides one place where you can create or connect workforce users and centrally manage their access across all their AWS accounts and applications. You can use _multi-account permissions_ to assign your workforce users access to AWS accounts. You can use _application assignments_ to assign your users access to IAM Identity Center enabled applications, cloud applications, and customer Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0) applications.
