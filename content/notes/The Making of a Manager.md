## Synopsis

_The Making of a Manager_ is a modern field guide packed everyday examples and transformative insights, including:  
  
  *****  How to tell a great manager from an average manager
  *****  When you should look past an awkward interview and hire someone anyway  
  *****  How to build trust with your reports through not being a boss  
  *****  Where to look when you lose faith and lack the answers  
  
Whether you’re new to the job, a veteran leader, or looking to be promoted, this is the handbook you need to be the kind of manager you wish you had.

## Reflection/Review

Some of the concepts in this book really opened my eyes on how I should approach management. One of the concepts that resonated with me is that delegation is key - I want to be perceived as a manager who is able to create better outcomes from a group of people than an Individual Contributor. 

Letting go is key - you cannot always own everything. I need to empower people to take up on responsibilities.

1:1s are absolute key to build a foundation of trust with colleagues.

	- [[The purpose is the outcome a team is trying to accomplish]]
	- [[To manage people well, they need to be set up for success]]
	- [[Coordination enables a team's independence and establishes the foundation for success]]
- [[The role of a manager can be given to someone, leadership is not something that can be bestowed]]
- [[By developing a relationship founded on trust, you can avoid being blindsided by people's dissatisfaction]]
	- [[Base respect on the person, not on performance]]
