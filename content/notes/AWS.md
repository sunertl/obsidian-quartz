I initially used Obsidian as a tool with which I created my own, private, local- and offline-first wiki for all things AWS. I wrote the majority of my notes while studying for AWS exams. 

I use plugins such as [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) to organize my notes and [Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) to study. The former is a way to query data in my [[Obsidian]] vault and display it (this is particularly helpful if I want to have an overview of related notes based on tags, keywords, etc.) and the latter enables me to create flashcards
