-   public key: cannot decrypt data but can generate cipher-text
-   private key: can decrypt data encrypted by the public key

The public key is uploaded to cloud storage. The data is encrypted and sent back to the original entity. The private key can decrypt the data.

This is secure because stolen public keys can only encrypt data. Private keys must be handled securely.
