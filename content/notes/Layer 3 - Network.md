## Overview


> [!Defintion] Defintion
> The primary responsibility of the network layer is routingâ€”providing mechanisms by which data can be passed from one network system to another. The network layer does not specify how the data is passed but rather provides the mechanisms to do so. Routers are considered layer 3 devices.

Protocols at the network layer are also responsible for route selection, which refers to determining the best path for the data to take throughout the network. In contrast to the [[Layer 2 - Data Link|data link layer]], which uses MAC addresses to communicate on the LAN, network layer protocols use software-configured addresses and special routing protocols to communicate on the network. The term packet describes the logical grouping of data at the network layer.

## Protocols & Technologies

Internet Protocol (IP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS), IP Security (IPSec), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS).
