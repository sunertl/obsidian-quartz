# Overview

**Amazon FSx for Windows File Server** provides fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable file storage that is accessible over the industry-standard Service Message Block (SMB) protocol. It is built on Windows Server, delivering a wide range of administrative features such as user quotas, end-user file restore, and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) integration. Amazon FSx is accessible from Windows, Linux, and MacOS compute instances and devices. Thousands of compute instances and devices can access a file system concurrently.

Amazon FSx works with Microsoft Active Directory to integrate with your existing Microsoft Windows environments. You have two options to provide user authentication and access control for your file system: AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory and Self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.

Take note that after you create an Active Directory configuration for a file system, you canâ€™t change that configuration. However, you can create a new file system from a backup and change the Active Directory integration configuration for that file system. These configurations allow the users in your domain to use their existing identity to access the Amazon FSx file system and to control access to individual files and folders.
