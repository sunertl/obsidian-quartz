- Extreme Ownership, Jocko Willink

- These leaders cast no blame. They made no excuses. Instead of complaining about challenges or setbacks, they developed solutions and solved problems. They leveraged assets, relationships, and resources to get the job done. Their own egos took a back seat to the mission and their troops. These leaders truly led. ([Location 34](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=34))
- Once people stop making excuses, stop blaming others, and take ownership of everything in their lives, they are compelled to take action to solve their problems. ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=44))
- leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield and the principles of good leadership do not change regardless of the mission, the environment, or the personalities of those involved. Leading is leading. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=72))
- The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas. They are simply focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=299))
- Extreme Ownership. Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=379))
- On any team, in any organization, all responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader. The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=589))
- The best leaders don’t just take responsibility for their job. They take Extreme Ownership of everything that impacts their mission. This fundamental core concept enables SEAL leaders to lead high-performing teams in extraordinary circumstances and win. But Extreme Ownership isn’t a principle whose application is limited to the battlefield. This concept is the number-one characteristic of any high-performance winning team, in any military unit, organization, sports team or business team in any industry. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=591))
- When subordinates aren’t doing what they should, leaders that exercise Extreme Ownership cannot blame the subordinates. They must first look in the mirror at themselves. The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to enable the team to properly and successfully execute. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=595))
- If an individual on the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must train and mentor that underperformer. But if the underperformer continually fails to meet standards, then a leader who exercises Extreme Ownership must be loyal to the team and the mission above any individual. If underperformers cannot improve, the leader must make the tough call to terminate them and hire others who can get the job done. It is all on the leader. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=597))
- Extreme Ownership requires leaders to look at an organization’s problems through the objective lens of reality, without emotional attachments to agendas or plans. It mandates that a leader set ego aside, accept responsibility for failures, attack weaknesses, and consistently work to build a better and more effective team. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=605))
- Such a leader, however, does not take credit for his or her team’s successes but bestows that honor upon his subordinate leaders and team members. When a leader sets such an example and expects this from junior leaders within the team, the mindset develops into the team’s culture at every level. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=607))
- With Extreme Ownership, junior leaders take charge of their smaller teams and their piece of the mission. Efficiency and effectiveness increase exponentially and a high-performance, winning team is the result. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=609))
- But it was a glaring, undeniable example of one of the most fundamental and important truths at the heart of Extreme Ownership: there are no bad teams, only bad leaders. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=855))
- The concept that there were no bad teams, only bad leaders was a difficult one to accept but nevertheless a crucial concept that leaders must fully understand and implement to enable them to most effectively lead a high-performance team. Leaders must accept total responsibility, own problems that inhibit performance, and develop solutions to those problems. A team could only deliver exceptional performance if a leader ensured the team worked together toward a focused goal and enforced high standards of performance, working to continuously improve. With a culture of Extreme Ownership within the team, every member of the team could contribute to this effort and ensure the highest levels of performance. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=876))
- When leaders who epitomize Extreme Ownership drive their teams to achieve a higher standard of performance, they must recognize that when it comes to standards, as a leader, it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate. ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=935))
- “There are only two types of leaders: effective and ineffective. Effective leaders that lead successful, high-performance teams exhibit Extreme Ownership. Anything else is simply ineffective. Anything else is bad leadership.” ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=1049))

 A leader must find a way to become effective and drive high performance within his or her team in order to win. Whether in SEAL training, in combat on distant battlefields, in business, or in life: there are no bad teams, only bad leaders.
