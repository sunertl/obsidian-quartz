Amazon OpenSearch Service manages the capacity, scaling, patching, and administration of your OpenSearch clusters while providing direct access to the OpenSearch API. The service is integrated with [[Amazon CloudWatch Logs]], so there are no additional requirements to write code for the movement or transformation of log data.
