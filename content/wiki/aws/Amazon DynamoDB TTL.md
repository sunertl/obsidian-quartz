# Overview

- TTL = Time to Live
- Automatically expire the items based on their timestamp and the TTL value that you specify
- Allows you to define a timestamp per item
- Deletes the item from your table after the date and time of the specified timestamp
- Reduces the number of obsolete data in your table which can also lower down your costs
