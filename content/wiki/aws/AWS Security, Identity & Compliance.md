## Identity & Access Management 

[[AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)]] provides fine-grained access control across all of AWS. With IAM, you can specify who can access which services and resources, and under which conditions. With IAM policies, you manage permissions to your workforce and systems to ensure least-privilege permissions. Consists of services for [[Identity]] and [[Access Management]].

[[AWS Organizations]] provide central governance and management across AWS accounts.

## Detection

### [[AWS CloudTrail]]

## Infrastructure Protection

[[AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)]] filters malicious web traffic.

[[AWS Shield]] is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. There are two tiers of AWS Shield - Standard and Advanced.
