# Overview

>[!Definition] Definition
AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources. SSL/TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the Internet as well as resources on private networks. AWS Certificate Manager removes the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates.

There are a handful of AWS services that work with an ACM: 

- [[Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)]]
- [[Amazon CloudFront]]
- [[Amazon Elastic Beanstalk]]
- [[Amazon API Gateway]]
