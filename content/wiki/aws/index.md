I initially used Obsidian as a tool with which I created my own, private, local- and offline-first wiki for all things AWS. I wrote the majority of my notes while studying for AWS exams. 

I use plugins such as [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) to organize my notes and [Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) to study. The former is a way to query data in my [[Obsidian]] vault and display it (this is particularly helpful if I want to have an overview of related notes based on tags, keywords, etc.) and the latter enables me to create flashcards 

Below is a list of [MOCs (Map of Content)](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/MOCs+(defn))-type notes that are following the same definitions as in AWS' official documentation - maybe that has changed at this point already? In any case and what I am trying to accomplish here is to that it's a way to organize my hundreds of AWS-related notes without searching for them individually by linking them to their 'parent' note.

As a disclaimer, these are my personal notes. The official documentation from AWS might have changed at this point which is evident by the many changes its products undergo during their lifecycle. Don't take these notes as gospel, they made sense to me when I created them.
