## Common Network Components

- [[Servers]]
- [[Hosts]]

## Network topology


> [!Definition] Definition
> Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network.

**Physical topology** defines the specific characteristics of a network, such as where all the workstations and other devices are located and the precise arrangement of all the physical media such as cables. -> what humans see!

**Logical typology** delineates exactly how data moves through the network. -> what the equipment sees!


### Physical topology

- [[Bus Topology]]
- [[Hub-and-Spoke Topology]]
- [[Ring Topology]]
- [[Mesh Topology]]
- [[Point-to-Point Topology]]
- [[Point-to-Multipoint Topology]]
- [[Hybrid Topology]]

### Logical topology

- [[LAN - Local Area Network]] 
- [[MAN - Metropolitan Area Network]]
- [[WAN - Wide Area Network]]

We get the word Internet from the term internetwork. An internetwork is a type of LAN and/or WAN that connects a bunch of networks, or intranets. In an internetwork, hosts still use hardware addresses to communicate with other hosts on the LAN. However, they use logical addresses (IP addresses) to communicate with hosts on a different LAN (on the other side of the router).

Routers are the devices that make this possible. Each connection into a router is a different logical network.

- PAN - Personal Area Network
	- For close proximity connections there are PANs, or personal area networks. 
	- These are seen with smartphones and laptops in a conference room where local connections are used to collaborate and send data between devices. 
	- While a PAN can use a wired connection such as Ethernet or USB, it is more common that short distance wireless connections are used such as Bluetooth, infrared, or ZigBee.
	- PANs are intended for close proximity between devices such as connecting to a projector, printer, or a coworker's computer, and they extend usually only a few meters.
- CAN - Campus Area Network
	- covers a limited geographical network such as a college or corporate campus.
	- The CAN typically interconnects LANs in various buildings and offers a Wi-Fi component for roaming users.
	- A campus area network is between a LAN and WAN in scope. 
	- They are larger than a local area network (LAN) but smaller than a metropolitan area network (MAN) or wide area network (WAN).
	- Most CANs offer Internet connectivity as well as access to data center resources.
- SAN - Storage Area Network
	- A storage area network (SAN) is designed for, and used exclusively by, storage systems. 
	- SANs interconnect servers to storage arrays containing centralized banks of hard drive or similar storage media. 
	- SANs are usually only found in data centers and do not mix traffic with other LANs. 
	- The protocols are designed specifically for storage with Fibre Channel being the most prevalent along with iSCSI. 
	- The network hardware is different from LAN switches and routers and are designed specifically to carry storage traffic.
- SDWAN - Software-Defined Wide Area Network
	- A software-defined wide area network (SDWAN) is a virtual WAN architecture that uses software to manage connectivity, devices, and services and can make changes in the network based on current operations.
	- SDWANs integrate any type of transport architectures such as MPLS, LTE, and broadband Internet services to securely connect users to applications. 
	- The SDWAN controller can make changes in real time to add or remove bandwidth or to route around failed circuits. 
	- SDWANs can simplify wide area networking management and operations by decoupling the networking hardware from its control mechanism.


## Network types

- [[Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks]]
- [[Client-Server Networks]]


## Other Concepts to Remember

### Network Bacbkbone

- It's what all the network segments and servers connect to and what gives the network its structure.
- Uses often Gigabit Ethernet -> fast and robust technology


### Network Segments

- Small section of the network that may be connected to, but isn't actually a piece of the backbone
- Network's workstations and servers organized into segments connect to the network backbone

### Service-Related Entry Points

- Defines the point of responsibility - more common term is **demarcation point** 


### Service Provider Links

- Service providers are Internet service providers and cable and telephone companies that provide networking services.


### Virtual Networking

- Common to provide networking services without deploying a hardware switch or router
- Companies such as VMware offer virtual switch (vSwitch) technology that provides the Ethernet switched and routing functions on the hypervisor, eliminating the need for external networking hardware. 
	- vSwitch similar to software virtualization!
- Virtualized servers do not have the means for inserting a hardware network interface card.
	- A virtual network interface card (vNIC) is installed to connect to the virtual device to the hypervisor, and from there, out to the LAN. 
- Network function virtualization (NFV) is the process of taking networking functions (routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, controllers) and virtualizing them.
	- this process allows all of these functions to run on a single device
- Hypervisor: is software that is installed directly on a bare metal server and allows for many virtual machines (VMs) to run thinking they are using the server's hardware directly.
