## OSI Model

For networking, two models commonly are referenced: the [[OSI Model]] and the [[TCP/IP model]]. Both offer a framework, theoretical and actual, for how networking is implemented. 

## Encapsulation Concepts

When a host transmits data across a network to another device, the data goes through encapsulation: it's wrapped with protocol information at each layer of the [[OSI Model]]. Each layer communicates only with its peer layer on the receiving device.

To communicate and exchange information, each layer uses [[Protocol Data Units (PDUs)]]. These hold the control information attached to the data at each layer of the model.
