## OSI Model

For networking, two models commonly are referenced: the [[OSI Model]] and the [[TCP/IP model]]. Both offer a framework, theoretical and actual, for how networking is implemented. 

## Encapsulation Concepts

When a host transmits data across a network to another device, the data goes through encapsulation: it's wrapped with protocol information at each layer of the [[OSI Model]]. Each layer communicates only with its peer layer on the receiving device.

To communicate and exchange information, each layer uses [[Protocol Data Units (PDUs)]]. These hold the control information attached to the data at each layer of the model.

Which layer chooses and determines the availability of communicating partners along with the resources necessary to make the connection, coordinates partnering applications, and forms a consensus on procedures for controlling data integrity and error recovery?;;The Application layer is responsible for finding the network resources broadcast from a server and adding flow control and error control (if the application developer chooses).

Which layer is responsible for converting frames from the Data Link layer into electrical signals?;;The Physical layer takes frames from the Data Link layer and encodes the 1s and 0s into a digital signal for transmission on the network medium.

At which layer is routing implemented, enabling connections and path selection between two end systems?;;The Network layer provides routing through an internetwork and logical addressing.

Which layer defines how data is formatted, presented, encoded, and converted?;;The Presentation layer makes sure that data is in a readable format for the Application layer.

Which layer is responsible for creating, managing, and terminating sessions between applications?;;The Session layer sets up, maintains, and terminates sessions between applications.

Which layer manages the transmission of data across a physical link and is primarily concerned with physical addressing and the ordered delivery of frames?;;Protocol data units (PDUs) at the Data Link layer are called frames. As soon as you see the word frame and/or the term physical addressing in a question, you know the answer is always Data Link layer.

Which layer is used for reliable communication between end nodes over the network and provides mechanisms for establishing, maintaining, and terminating virtual circuits as well as controlling the flow of information?;;The Transport layer uses virtual circuits to create a reliable connection between two hosts.

Which layer provides logical addressing that routers use for path determination?;;The Network layer provides logical addressing, IP and/or IPv6 addressing, and routing.

Which layer specifies voltage, wire speed, and connector pin- outs and moves bits between devices?;;The Physical layer is responsible for the electrical and mechanical connections between devices.

Which layer combines bits into bytes and bytes into frames and uses MAC addressing?;;The Data Link layer is responsible for the framing of data packets.

Host 1 sent a SYN packet to Host 2. What will Host 2 send in
response? 
> A. ACK 
> 
> B. NAK
> 
> C. SYN/ACK 
> 
> D. SYN/NAK
> 
> E. SYN
?
C. A connection-oriented session is set up using what is called a three-way handshake. The transmitting host sends a SYN packet, the receiving host sends a SYN/ACK, and the transmitting host replies with the last ACK packet. The session is now set up.

TCP and UDP reside at which layer of the OSI model?
>A. 1 
>
>B. 2 
>

Which layer of the OSI model provides an entry point for programs to access the network infrastructure?
>A. Application 
>
>B. Transport 
>
>C. Network
>
>D. Physical
?
A. The top layer of the OSI model gives applications access to the services that allow network access.

You are connected to a server on the Internet and you click a link on the server and receive a time-out message. What layer could be the source of this message?
>A. Application
>

>
>B. Data Link, Data Link, Network 
>
>C. Data Link, Physical, Network
>
>D. Physical, Data Link, Network
?
C. Bridges, like switches, are Data Link layer devices. Hubs, like repeaters, are Physical layer devices. Routers are Network layer devices.

Which layer of the OSI model is responsible for converting data into signals appropriate for the transmission medium?
>A. Application 
>
>B. Network
>
>C. Data Link
>
>D. Physical
?
D. The Physical layer's job is to convert data into impulses that are designed for the wired or wireless medium being used on the attached segment.

A receiving host has failed to receive all the segments that it should acknowledge. What can the host do to improve the reliability of this communication session?
>A. Send a different source port number.
>
>B. Restart the virtual circuit.
>
>C. Decrease the sequence number.
>
>D. Decrease the window size.
?
D. A receiving host can control the transmitter by using flow control (TCP uses windowing by default). By decreasing the window size, the receiving host can slow down the transmitting host so the receiving host does not overflow its buffers.

>A. Firewall 
>
>B. NIC
>
>C. Hub
>
>D. Repeater
>
>E. RJ-45 transceiver
?
C, D. Not that you really want to enlarge a single collision domain, but a hub (multiport repeater) will provide this functionality for you.

Segmentation of a data stream happens at which layer of the OSI model?
>A. Physical 
>
>B. Data Link 
>
>C. Network
>
>D. Transport
?
D. The Transport layer receives large data streams from the upper layers and breaks these up into smaller pieces called segments.

When data is encapsulated, which is the correct order?
>A. Data, frame, packet, segment, bits
>
>B. Segment, data, packet, frame, bits
>
>C. Data, segment, packet, frame, bits

?
C. The encapsulation order is data, segment, packet, frame, bits.
<!--SR:!2024-02-20,3,250-->

What are two purposes for segmentation with a bridge? (Choose two.)
>A. To add more broadcast domains 
>
>B. To create more collision domains 
>
>C. To add more bandwidth for users
>
>D. To allow more broadcasts for users

B, C. Bridges and switches break up collision domains, which allows more bandwidth for users.

Acknowledgments, sequencing, and flow control are characteristic of which OSI layer?
>A. Layer 2 
>
>B. Layer 3
>
>C. Layer 4 
>
>D. Layer 7
?
C. A reliable Transport layer connection uses acknowledgments to make sure all data is received reliably. A reliable connection is defined by the use of acknowledgments, sequencing, and flow control, which is characteristic of the Transport layer (layer 4).

Which of the following is true regarding sequencing and acknowledgments? (Choose all that apply.)
>A. The segments delivered are acknowledged back to the sender upon their reception.
>
>B. If a segment is not received, the virtual circuit must be restarted from the beginning at a slower transmit interval.
>
>C. Any segments not acknowledged are retransmitted.
>
>D. Segments are sequenced back into their proper order upon arrival at their destination.
>
>E. All segments are retransmitted on time slot intervals.
?
A, C, D. When sequencing and acknowledgments are used, the segments delivered are acknowledged back to the sender upon their reception. At this point, any segments not acknowledged are retransmitted, and segments are sequenced back into their proper order upon arrival at their destination.

What is the purpose of flow control?
>A. To ensure that data is retransmitted if an acknowledgment is not received
>
>B. To reassemble segments in the correct order at the destination device
>
>C. To provide a means for the receiver to govern the amount of data sent by the sender
>
>D. To regulate the size of each segment
?
C. Flow control allows the receiving device to control the pace of the transmitting device so the receiving device's buffer does not overflow.

At which layer of the OSI model would you find IP?
>A. Transport 
>
>B. Network 
>
>C. Data Link

>D. Physical
?
B. IP is a Network layer protocol. TCP is an example of a Transport layer protocol, Ethernet is an example of a Data Link layer protocol, and T1 can be considered a Physical layer protocol.

Of the following, which is the highest layer in the OSI model?
>A. Transport 
>
>B. Session 
>
>C. Network
>
>D. Presentation
?
D. The Presentation layer is the sixth layer of the model. Only the Application layer is higher, but it is not listed. Session is layer 5, Transport is layer 4, and Network is layer 3.

Routers perform routing at which OSI layer?
>A. Physical 
>
>B. Data Link 
>
>C. Network
>
>D. Transport 
>
>E. Application
?
C. A router is specified at the Network layer and a router routes packets. Routers can also be called layer 3 switches.

Which of the following mnemonic devices can you use to remember the first letter of the name of each layer of the OSI model in the proper order?
>A. All People Seem To Need Processed Data.
>
>B. Always Should People Never Threaten Dog Police. 
>
>C. Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away.
>
>D. All Day People Should Try New Professions.
?
C. The phrase “Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away” contains the first letters of the layers in order, from layer 1 through layer 7. “All People Seem To Need Data Processing” works from the top down. The other options have all the right letters, just not in the right order.

Which IEEE standard specifies the protocol for CSMA/CD?
>A. 802.2 
>
>B. 802.3 
>
>C. 802.5
>
>D. 802.11
?
B. The 802.3 standard, commonly associated with Ethernet, specifies the media-access method used by Ethernet, which is known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).

At which of the following layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model do the protocols on a typical local area network (LAN) use media access control (MAC) addresses to identify other computers on the network?
> A. Physical

> B. Data link
> 
> C. Network
> 
> D. Transport
?
B. The Ethernet (or IEEE 802.3) protocol at the data link layer uses MAC addresses to iden- tify computers on the local network. MAC addresses are coded into the firmware of physical network interface adapters by the manufacturer. The physical layer deals with signals and
is not involved in addressing. The IP protocol at the network layer has its own addressing system. The transport layer protocols are not involved in addressing.

Which of the following organizations developed the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model?
> A. International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)
> 
> B. Comité Consultatif International Télégraphique et Téléphonique (CCITT)
> 
> C. American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
> 
> D. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
> 
> E. International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
?
E. ISO developed and published the OSI model to serve as a conceptual model for soft- ware and hardware developers. The ITU-T, formerly known as the CCITT, coordinates the development and advancement of international telecommunication networks and services. ANSI is a private organization that administers and coordinates a United States–based standardization and conformity assessment system. The IEEE publishes standards that define data link and physical layer standards. These standards are referred to collectively as the 802 series.

Which layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is responsible for the logical addressing of end systems and the routing of datagrams on a network?
>A. Physical
>
>B. Data link
>
>C. Network
>
>D. Transport
>
>E. Session
>
>F. Presentation
>
>G. Application
?
C. Network layer protocols (such as IP) contain headers that specify logical addresses for end system communication and route datagrams across a network. The physical layer defines standards for physical and mechanical characteristics of a network. The data link layer uses media access control (MAC) or hardware addresses, not logical addresses. The transport layer uses port numbers, not logical addresses. Session layer protocols create and maintain a dialogue between end systems. Presentation layer protocols are responsible for the format- ting, translation, and presentation of information. The application layer provides an entry point for applications to access the protocol stack and prepare information for transmission across a network.

On a TCP/IP network, which layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model con- tain protocols that are responsible for encapsulating the data generated by an application, creating the payload for a packet that will be transmitted over a network? (Choose all that apply.)
> A. Physical
> 
> B. Data link
> 
> C. Network
> 
> D. Transport
> 
> E. Session
> 
> F. Presentation
> 
> G. Application
?
B, C, D. Before the payload data generated by an application can be transmitted over a TCP/ IP network, the system must encapsulate it by applying protocol headers and footers at three layers of the OSI model. The data link layer applies a header and footer to create an Ether- net frame. The network layer applies a header to create an IP datagram. The transport layer applies a TCP or UDP header to create a segment or datagram. The other model layers are involved in the payload transmission process, but they do not encapsulate the payload.
