## Overview

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It's easy for humans to read and write. It's easy for machines to parse and generate.
- JSON doesn't care about indentation - more forgiving with spacing
- An object in JSON is similar to a dictionary in [[YAML]]: it's an unordered set of `key:value` pairs enclosed by `{}`.
- An array in JSON is similar to a list in [[YAML]]: it's an ordered collection of values, separated by commas and enclosed in `[]`.
	-  values = string, object, number, array, true, false, null
- It's used within AWS as one of two [[AWS CloudFormation]] template formats and for [[Identity-Based Policy|identity]] and [[Resource-Based Policy|resource]].
