## Overview

>[!Definition] Definition
>AWS KMS keys (KMS keys) are the primary resource in AWS KMS. You can use a KMS key to encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt data. It can also generate [[Data Encryption Key|data keys]] that you can use outside of AWS KMS. Typically, you'll use [[Symmetric Encryption KMS Keys]], but you can create and use [[Asymmetric KMS Keys|asymmetric KMS keys]] for encryption or signing, and create and use HMAC KMS keys to generate and verify HMAC tags.

- Are used by KMS within cryptographic operations
- They are used by the user, applications and other AWS services
- They are logical - think of them as containers for the actual physical key material
	- It contains a key ID (which is a unique identifier for the key)
	- creation date 
	- Key policy (which is actually a [[Resource-Based Policy|resource policy]])
	- description and a state of the key
- Every KMS key is backed by physical key material - it's the material that is used to encrypt and decrypt things that you give to KMS
- This physical material can be generated by KMS or imported into KMS
- You cannot extract, export, view, or manage this key material
	- The only exception is the public key of an asymmetric key pair, which you can export for use outside of AWS.

>[!Important]
KMS Keys can encrypt or decrypt data that is a maximum of 4KB.
