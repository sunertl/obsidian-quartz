I initially used Obsidian as a tool with which I created my own, private, local- and offline-first Wikipedia for all things AWS. I wrote the majority of my notes while studying for AWS exams. These notes are for my own private use only.

I use plugins such as [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) to organize my notes and [Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) to study. Some of these notes still require the use of plugins to get displayed - Obsidian's own publishing service doesn't support the use of plugins yet.
