### On writing itself

- Clear writing is the logical arrangement of thought; a scientist who thinks clearly can write as well as the best writer.
- Learning, he seemed to be saying, takes a multitude of forms; expect to find them in places where you least expect them to be. 
- Writing, however, isn’t a special language that belongs to English teachers and a few other sensitive souls who have a “gift for words.” Writing is thinking on paper. Anyone who thinks clearly should be able to write clearly—about any subject at all. 
- Writing is learned by imitation. I learned to write mainly by reading writers who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and by trying to figure out how they did it. 
- Another is that the essence of writing is rewriting. Very few writers say on their first try exactly what they want to say. 
- Writing organizes and clarifies our thoughts. Writing is how we think our way into a subject and make it our own. Writing enables us to find out what we know—and what we don’t know—about whatever we’re trying to learn.
- Putting an idea into written words is like defrosting the windshield: The idea, so vague out there in the murk, slowly begins to gather itself into a sensible shape. Whatever we write—a memo, a letter, a note to the baby-sitter—all of us know this moment of finding out what we really want to say by trying in writing to say it. 
- This was the aspect of “writing across the curriculum” that excited me most of all. It was an idea based on two principles: learning to write and writing to learn. 
- Writing was such an avenue—perhaps, in fact, the main route.  
- It’s not enough for a nonfiction writer to just write good, clean sentences; he must organize those sentences into a coherent shape, taking the reader on a complicated trip—often with several flashbacks—without losing him or boring him.  
- Readers must be given room to bring their own emotions to a piece so crammed with emotional content; the writer must tenaciously resist explaining why the material is so moving.)  
- Only by repeated applications of process—writing and rewriting and pruning and shaping—can we hammer out a clear and simple product.  
- Writing is a tool that enables people in every discipline to wrestle with facts and ideas. It’s a physical activity, unlike reading. Writing requires us to operate some kind of mechanism—pencil, pen, typewriter, word processor—for getting our thoughts on paper. It compels us by the repeated effort of language to go after those thoughts and to organize them and present them clearly. It forces us to keep asking, “Am I saying what I want to say?” Very often the answer is “No.” It’s a useful piece of information. 
- Therefore, for the purposes of this book, I’ll generalize outrageously and state that there are two kinds of writing. One is explanatory writing: writing that transmits existing information or ideas. Call it Type A writing. The other is exploratory writing: writing that enables us to discover what we want to say. Call it Type B. They are equally valid and useful. 
- My advice to Type A writers begins with one word: Think! Ask yourself, “What do I want to say?” Then try to say it. Then ask yourself, “Have I said it?” Put yourself in the reader’s mind: Is your sentence absolutely clear to someone who knows nothing about the subject? If not, think about how to make it clear. Then rewrite it. Then think: “What do I need to say next? Will it lead logically out of what I’ve just written? Will it also lead logically toward where I want to go?” If it will, write the sentence. Then ask yourself, “Did it do the job I wanted it to do, with no ambiguity?” If it did, think: “Now what does the reader need to know?” Keep thinking and writing and rewriting. If you force yourself to think clearly you will write clearly. It’s as simple as that. The hard part isn’t the writing; the hard part is the thinking.
- Type B writing—exploratory writing—requires no such cogitation, no prior decisions about which road to take; the road will reveal itself. Today many of America’s best writing teachers believe that this is the only kind of writing worth teaching, especially to young children. Unlike Type A writing, which they consider mainly a technical skill, Type B writing is a voyage of discovery into the self. Only by going into uncharted territory, they feel, can a writer find his potential and his voice and his meaning. Meaning, in fact, doesn’t exist until a writer goes looking for it.  
- What makes good writing good and bad writing bad? Here are some notions that are important to me. 

### 11 notions 

- By contrast, the fiction writer—the writer of novels and short stories—is accountable only to his art. His gift is that he can take us into interior worlds where the fact-bound writer can’t go: worlds of imagination, rumination and fantasy. In return we enter into a more forgiving contract with him, allowing him to come at his subject slowly, discursively, obliquely, elliptically or just plain densely if that’s his vision.  
- No such immunity is granted the nonfiction writer. He can do all kinds of things wrong. He is endlessly accountable: to the facts, to the people he is writing about, to his “quotes,” to the mood, to the ethical nuances of the story. He is also accountable to his readers. They won’t put up with being delayed, lost, confused, bored or taken down unnecessary trails by failures of craft.  
- In information parlance, the enemy is “noise”—a perfect word for all the random interferences with what man or nature is trying to say. Noise is the typographical error and the poorly designed page and the caption that doesn’t quite explain what’s happening in the picture. Noise is handwriting that’s hard to read. Noise is distortion on the TV screen. Noise is the lapse of memory, the slip of the tongue, the wrong neuron fired by the brain—anything that brings disorder to the intended order of a message. So pervasive is noise, disorder being such a strong natural force, that nature has evolved an infinite number of backup systems for getting messages to their destination “more or less in the original form,” as Campbell puts it. “In nearly all forms of communication, more messages are sent than are strictly necessary to convey the information intended by the sender.”  
- Ambiguity is noise. Redundancy is noise. Misuse of words is noise. Vagueness is noise. Jargon is noise. Pomposity is noise. Clutter is noise: all those unnecessary adjectives (“ongoing progress”), all those unnecessary adverbs (“successfully avoided”), all those unnecessary prepositions draped onto verbs (“order up”), all those unnecessary phrases (“in a very real sense”). Information is your sacred product, and noise is its pollutant. Guard the message with your life. 
- Not for them the short words and active verbs and concrete details of ordinary speech; they believe that a simple style is the sign of a simple mind. Actually a simple style is the result of harder thinking and harder work than they are willing or able to do.  
- people who write obscurely are either unskilled in writing or up to mischief.  
- In writing, short is usually better than long. Short words and sentences are easier for the eye and the mind to process than long ones, and an article that makes its case succinctly is the highest form of courtesy to the reader. Somehow it never occurs to sloppy writers that they are being fundamentally rude. Most pieces can be cut by 50 percent without losing any substance.  
- Brevity is one sign of a well-organized mind. 
- Jargon is the lingo of people in specialized fields who have infected each other with their private terminology and don’t think there’s any other way to say what they mean. 
- The people writing and talking most pompously in America today are people in authority. 
- They are words that make the insider feel important when he uses them but that don’t really mean anything. 
- But any specialist who doesn’t clean up his jargon when he’s writing for the general population deserves to be, if not tarred, at least feathered by the mob.
- If clear writing is one of the foundations of a democratic society, don’t count on getting it from men and women with a college degree. Ivy League alumni magazines are awash with letters so grammatically squalid that they barely make sense. Clean-up time at this toxic dump has to start at the top.
- Nouns that denote concepts are the death of vigorous writing. Good writing is specific and concrete. 
- We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.  
- One way to take the mush out of concept nouns is to turn them into active verbs. Verbs are the strongest tools a writer is given, because they embody an action. Active verbs are stronger than passive verbs, because they propel a sentence forward. Passive verbs have no such energy or precision.
- The writer should not only tell a story; he should try to make the reader see what he is writing about.  
- I mean the thousands of simple nouns, like “house” and “chair” and “earth” and “tree,” that denote the objects of everyday life and the properties of the world we live in. Unlike the long concept nouns, which tend to be of Latin origin and to end in “ion,” these are Anglo-Saxon words—short, blunt, homely and infinitely old. They are words that are in our bones and that resonate with emotions, whether we want them to or not. A writer who uses these nouns makes instant contact with the humanity of his reader by giving him a familiar picture. 
- He was also talking about courage. Humor is the most perilous of writing forms, full of risk; to make a vocation of brightening the reader’s day is an act of continuing gallantry. He was also talking about energy. Energy is the divine spark in creative work. We know right away when we are in its presence—we can’t hold Bach or Mozart down, or Picasso, or Mark Twain, or Frank Lloyd Wright, or Louise Nevelson, or Fred Astaire, or Lucille Ball, or Toscanini or Norman Mailer or Tom Wolfe. They sweep us along in the current of their life force. We seldom stop to think about the effort they made to switch it on and crank it up every morning.  
- But what Perelman was finally talking about was craft. Writing is a craft, and a writer is someone who goes to work every day with his tools, like the carpenter or the television repairman, no matter how he feels, and if one of the things he wants to produce by 6 P.M. is a sense of enjoyment in his writing, he must generate it by an act of will. Nobody else is going to do it for him.  
- This is the gift that good science writing can bestow in all those disciplines where the scale is so unfathomably large, like astronomy, or so unfathomably small, like cell biology and sub-atomic physics, that we can only imagine what is being described. Language is our rope ladder across the abyss.
