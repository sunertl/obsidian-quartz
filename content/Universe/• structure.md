## Folders

- limited use of folders, but necessity for publishing

## Tags

- plurals
- MOC / HON always written out, nested tags can be abbreviated


## Properties / Metadata

- tags in the actual note
	- create a line at the bottom for tags/references so it doesn't disturb the flow of reading/not getting distracted when seeing the note for the first time
		- HA! Not great doing it like that - when you enable backlinks in the note itself, it creates a line separator below the tags
- metadata in properties - I guess Obsidian Publish will add the ability to read YAML
	- hopefully will safe me some time in the future
