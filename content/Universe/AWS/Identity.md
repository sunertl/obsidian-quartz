An identity helps to understand who are the validated users or entities in your organization. Identities can be an [[IAM User |IAM user]], [[IAM Group |IAM group]] or [[IAM Role|IAM role]]. Identities are managed through the AWS service [[AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)]].

Identities are part of an [[AWS Account]].
