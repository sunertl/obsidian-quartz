## Network topology


> [!Definition] Definition
> Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network.

**Physical topology** defines the specific characteristics of a network, such as where all the workstations and other devices are located and the precise arrangement of all the physical media such as cables. -> what humans see!

**Logical typology** delineates exactly how data moves through the network. -> what the equipment sees!


### Physical topology

- [[Bus Topology]]
- [[Hub-and-Spoke Topology]]
- [[Ring Topology]]
- [[Mesh Topology]]
- [[Point-to-Point Topology]]
- [[Point-to-Multipoint Topology]]
- [[Hybrid Topology]]

### Logical topology

- [[LAN - Local Area Network]] 
- [[MAN - Metropolitan Area Network]]
- [[WAN - Wide Area Network]]

We get the word Internet from the term internetwork. An internetwork is a type of LAN and/or WAN that connects a bunch of networks, or intranets. In an internetwork, hosts still use hardware addresses to communicate with other hosts on the LAN. However, they use logical addresses (IP addresses) to communicate with hosts on a different LAN (on the other side of the router).

Routers are the devices that make this possible. Each connection into a router is a different logical network.

- PAN - Personal Area Network
	- For close proximity connections there are PANs, or personal area networks. 
	- These are seen with smartphones and laptops in a conference room where local connections are used to collaborate and send data between devices. 
	- While a PAN can use a wired connection such as Ethernet or USB, it is more common that short distance wireless connections are used such as Bluetooth, infrared, or ZigBee.
	- PANs are intended for close proximity between devices such as connecting to a projector, printer, or a coworker's computer, and they extend usually only a few meters.
- CAN - Campus Area Network
	- covers a limited geographical network such as a college or corporate campus.
	- The CAN typically interconnects LANs in various buildings and offers a Wi-Fi component for roaming users.
	- A campus area network is between a LAN and WAN in scope. 
	- They are larger than a local area network (LAN) but smaller than a metropolitan area network (MAN) or wide area network (WAN).
	- Most CANs offer Internet connectivity as well as access to data center resources.
- SAN - Storage Area Network
	- A storage area network (SAN) is designed for, and used exclusively by, storage systems. 
	- SANs interconnect servers to storage arrays containing centralized banks of hard drive or similar storage media. 
	- SANs are usually only found in data centers and do not mix traffic with other LANs. 
	- The protocols are designed specifically for storage with Fibre Channel being the most prevalent along with iSCSI. 
	- The network hardware is different from LAN switches and routers and are designed specifically to carry storage traffic.
- SDWAN - Software-Defined Wide Area Network
	- A software-defined wide area network (SDWAN) is a virtual WAN architecture that uses software to manage connectivity, devices, and services and can make changes in the network based on current operations.
	- SDWANs integrate any type of transport architectures such as MPLS, LTE, and broadband Internet services to securely connect users to applications. 
	- The SDWAN controller can make changes in real time to add or remove bandwidth or to route around failed circuits. 
	- SDWANs can simplify wide area networking management and operations by decoupling the networking hardware from its control mechanism.


## Network types

- [[Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks]]
- [[Client-Server Networks]]


## Other Concepts to Remember

### Network Bacbkbone

- It's what all the network segments and servers connect to and what gives the network its structure.
- Uses often Gigabit Ethernet -> fast and robust technology


### Network Segments

- Small section of the network that may be connected to, but isn't actually a piece of the backbone
- Network's workstations and servers organized into segments connect to the network backbone

### Service-Related Entry Points

- Defines the point of responsibility - more common term is **demarcation point** 


### Service Provider Links

- Service providers are Internet service providers and cable and telephone companies that provide networking services.


### Virtual Networking

- Common to provide networking services without deploying a hardware switch or router
- Companies such as VMware offer virtual switch (vSwitch) technology that provides the Ethernet switched and routing functions on the hypervisor, eliminating the need for external networking hardware. 
	- vSwitch similar to software virtualization!
- Virtualized servers do not have the means for inserting a hardware network interface card.
	- A virtual network interface card (vNIC) is installed to connect to the virtual device to the hypervisor, and from there, out to the LAN. 
- Network function virtualization (NFV) is the process of taking networking functions (routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, controllers) and virtualizing them.
	- this process allows all of these functions to run on a single device
- Hypervisor: is software that is installed directly on a bare metal server and allows for many virtual machines (VMs) to run thinking they are using the server's hardware directly. 

## Flash Cards

#flashcards/network-fundamentals/1-2

You need a network that provides centralized authentication for your users. Which of the following logical topologies should you use?
> A. VLANs
> 
> B. Peer-to-peer
> 
> C. Client-server
> 
> D. Mesh
?
C. A client-server logical topology allows you to have a centralized database of users so that authentication is provided in one place.

You need a topology that is scalable to use in your network. Which of the following will you install?
> A. Bus
> 
> B. Ring
> 
> C. Star
> 
> D. Mesh
?
C. To install a physical topology that provides ease of scalability, use a star network. This is a hub or switch device, and this is the most common LAN network today.

Which of the following physical topologies has the most connections and is the least popular for LANs?
> A. Bus
> 
> B. Star
> 
> C. Ring
> 
> D. Mesh
?
D. Only a mesh physical topology has point-to-point connections to every device, so it has more connections and is not a popular LAN technology.

In a physical star topology, what happens when a workstation loses its physical connection to another device?
> A. The ring is broken, so no devices can communicate
> 
> B. Only that workstation loses its ability to communicate
> 
> C. That workstation and the device it's connected to lose communication with the rest of the network
> 
> D. No devices can communicate because there are now two unterminated network segments.
?
B. In a star topology, each workstation connects to a hub, switch, or similar central device but not to other workstations. The benefit is that when connectivity to the central device is lost, the rest of the network lives on.

Which type of WAN technology uses labels, which enables priority of voice through the network?
> A. VPN
> 
> B. T1
> 
> C. MPLS
> 
> D. LAN
> 
> E. Bus
?
C. Multiprotocol Label Switching has as many advantages as a LAN protocol. When labels are used, voice can have priority over basic data, for example.

What is a logical grouping of network users and resources called?
> A. WAN
> 
> B. LAN
> 
> C. MLPS
> 
> D. Host
?
B. A logical grouping of hosts is called a LAN, and you typically group them by connecting them to a hub or switch.

Which of the following is a concern when using peer-to-peer networks?
> A. Where to place the server
> 
> B. Whose computer is least busy and can act as the server
> 
> C. The security associated with such a network
> 
> D. Having enoough peers to support creating such a network
?
C. It is easy to relax about security in a peer-to-peer environment. Because of the trouble it takes to standardize authentication, a piecemeal approach involving users' personal preferences develops. There are no dedicated servers in a peer- to-peer network, and such a network can be created with as few as two computers.

Which of the following is an example of when a point-to- multipoint network is called for?
> A. When a centralized office needs to communicate with many branch offices
> 
> B. When a full mesh of WAN links is in place
> 
> C. When multiple offices are daisy-chained to one another in a line
> 
> D. When there are only two nodes in the network to be connected
?
A. When a central office, such as headquarters, needs to communicate directly with its branch offices but the branches do not require direct communication with one another, the point- to-multipoint model is applicable. The other scenarios tend to indicate the use of a point-to-point link between sites.

Which of the following is an example of a LAN?
>A. Ten buildings interconnected by Ethernet connections over fiber-optic cabling
>
>B. Ten routers interconnected by Frame Relay circuits
>
>C. Two routers interconnected with a T1 circuit
>
>D. A computer connected to another computer so they can share resources
?
D. LANs generally have a geographic scope of a single building or smaller. They can range from simple (two hosts) to complex (with thousands of hosts).

Which of the following is a disadvantage of the star topology?
> A. When a single port on the central concentrating device fails, the entire network loses connectivity.
> 
> B. When the central concentrating device experiences a complete failure, all attached devices lose connectivity to the rest of the network.
> 
> C. In a star topology, a more expensive type of host must be used compared to the host used when implementing a physical bus.
> 
> D. It is more difficult to add stations and troubleshoot than with other topologies.
?
B. The only disadvantage mentioned is the fact that there is a single point of failure in the network. However, this topology makes troubleshooting easier; if the entire network fails, you know where to look first. The central device also ensures that the loss of a single port and the addition of a new device to an available port do not disrupt the network for other stations attached to such a device.

What is a difference between a LAN and a WAN?
> A. WANs require a router.
> 
> B. WANs cover larger geographical areas
> 
> C. WANs can utilize either private or public data transport.
> 
> D. All of the above.
?
D. A typical WAN connects two or more remote LANs together using someone else's network (your ISP's) and a router. Your local host and router see these networks as remote networks and not as local networks or local resources. Routers use proprietary serial connections for WANs.

Which of the following provides the most physical layout flexibility in a very large, geographically dispersed enterprise network?
>A. Bus topology
>
>B. LAN switch
>
>C. Star topology
>
>D. MPLS cloud network
?
D. Multiprotocol Label Switching provides logical links between sites, so branch offices can be easily and quickly added.

In what type of network are all computers considered equal and do not share any central authority?
> A. Peer-to-peer
> 
> B. Client-server
> 
> C. Physical topology
> 
> D. None of the above
?
A. In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are considered equal. It is up to the computer that has the resource being requested to perform a security check for access rights to its resources.

What advantage does the client-server architecture have over peer-to-peer?
>A. Easier maintenance
>
>B. Greater organization
>
>C. Tighter security
>
>D. All of the above
?
D. In client-server networks, requests for resources go to a main server that responds by handling security and directing the client to the resource it wants instead of the request going directly to the machine with the desired resource (as in peer-to- peer).

Which of the following is an example of a hybrid network?
>A. Ethernet switch
>
>B. Ring topology
>
>C. Bus topology
>
>D. Star topology
?
A. The best answer to this question is an Ethernet switch, which uses a star physical topology with a logical bus technology.

You have a network with multiple LANs and want to keep them separate but still connect them together so they can all get to the Internet. Which of the following is the best solution?
>A. Use static IP addresses
>
>B. Add more hubs
>
>C. Implement more switches
>
>D. Install a router
?
D. Routers are used to connect different networks together.

Which type of topology has the greatest number of physical connections?
> A. Point-to-multipoint
> 
> B. Star
> 
> C. Point-to-point
> 
> D. Mesh
?
D. In the mesh topology, there is a path from each connection to every other one in the network. A mesh topology is used mainly because of the robust fault tolerance it offers—if one connection goes on the blink, computers and other network devices can simply switch to one of the many redundant connections that are up and running.

What type of topology gives you a direct connection between two routers so that there is one communication path?
>A. Point-to-point
>
>B. Star
>
>C. Bus
>
>D. Straight
?
A. As its name implies, in a point-to-point topology you have a direct connection between two routers, giving you one communication path. The routers in a point-to-point topology can either be linked by a serial cable, making it a physical network, or be far away and only connected by a circuit within a Frame Relay network, making it a logical network.

Which network topology is a combination of two or more types of physical or two or more types of logical topologies?
> A. Cost
> 
> B. Ease of installation
> 
> C. Ease of maintenance
> 
> D. Fault-tolerance requirements
?
B. A hybrid topology is a combination of two or more types of physical or logical network topologies working together within the same network.

When designing a network and deciding which type of network topology to use, which item(s) should be considered? (Choose all that apply.)
>A. Cost
>
>B. Ease of installation
>
>C. Ease of maintenance
>
>D. Fault-tolerance requirements
?
A, B, C, D. Each topology has its own set of pros and cons regarding implementation, so it's important to ask the right questions and consider cost, ease of installation, maintenance, and fault tolerance.
