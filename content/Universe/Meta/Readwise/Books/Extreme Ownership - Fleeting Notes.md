## Highlights
- These leaders cast no blame. They made no excuses. Instead of complaining about challenges or setbacks, they developed solutions and solved problems. They leveraged assets, relationships, and resources to get the job done. Their own egos took a back seat to the mission and their troops. These leaders truly led.

- Once people stop making excuses, stop blaming others, and take ownership of everything in their lives, they are compelled to take action to solve their problems. ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=44))
- leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield and the principles of good leadership do not change regardless of the mission, the environment, or the personalities of those involved. Leading is leading. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=72))
