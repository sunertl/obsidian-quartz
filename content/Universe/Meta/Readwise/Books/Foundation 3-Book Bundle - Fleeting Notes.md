## Highlights
- “As Trantor becomes more specialized, it becomes more vulnerable, less able to defend itself. Further, as it becomes more and more the administrative center of Empire, it becomes a greater prize. As the Imperial succession becomes more and more uncertain, and the feuds among the great families more rampant, social responsibility disappears.” ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KZ8SNS6&location=310))
- The psychohistoric trend of a planet-full of people contains a huge inertia. To be changed it must be met with something possessing a similar inertia. Either as many people must be concerned, or if the number of people be relatively small, enormous time for change must be allowed. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KZ8SNS6&location=445))
- “It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety.” ([Location 1316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KZ8SNS6&location=1316))
