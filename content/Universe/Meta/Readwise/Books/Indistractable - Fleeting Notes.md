## Highlights
- I discovered that living the life we want requires not only doing the right things; it also requires we stop doing the wrong things that take us off track. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=232))
- Even when we think we’re seeking pleasure, we’re actually driven by the desire to free ourselves from the pain of wanting. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=396))
- Simply put, the drive to relieve discomfort is the root cause of all our behavior, while everything else is a proximate cause. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=400))
- The distractions in our lives are the result of the same forces—they are proximate causes that we think are to blame, while the root causes stay hidden. We tend to blame things like television, junk food, social media, cigarettes, and video games—but these are all proximate causes of our distraction. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=412))
- Solely blaming a smartphone for causing distraction is just as flawed as blaming a pedometer for making someone climb too many stairs. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=415))
- Unless we deal with the root causes of our distraction, we’ll continue to find ways to distract ourselves. Distraction, it turns out, isn’t about the distraction itself; rather, it’s about how we respond to it. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=416))
- Most people don’t want to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth that distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=433))
- Only by understanding our pain can we begin to control it and find better ways to deal with negative urges. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=439))
- Understand the root cause of distraction. Distraction is about more than your devices. Separate proximate causes from the root cause. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=450))
- All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort. If a behavior was previously effective at providing relief, we’re likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=452))
- Anything that stops discomfort is potentially addictive, but that doesn’t make it irresistible. If you know the drivers of your behavior, you can take steps to manage them. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=454))
- As is the case with all human behavior, distraction is just another way our brains attempt to deal with pain. If we accept this fact, it makes sense that the only way to handle distraction is by learning to handle discomfort. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=461))
- If distraction costs us time, then time management is pain management. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=463))
- STEP 1: LOOK FOR THE DISCOMFORT THAT PRECEDES THE DISTRACTION, FOCUSING IN ON THE INTERNAL TRIGGER ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=601))
- STEP 2: WRITE DOWN THE TRIGGER ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=606))
- STEP 3: EXPLORE YOUR SENSATIONS ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=616))
- STEP 4: BEWARE OF LIMINAL MOMENTS ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=627))
- “The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.” ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=697))
- Fun is looking for the variability in something other people don’t notice. It’s breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover its hidden beauty. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=699))
- Syncing your schedule with stakeholders at work is critical for making time for traction in your day. Without visibility into how you spend your time, colleagues and managers are more likely to distract you with superfluous tasks. ([Location 1147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1147))
- Sync as frequently as your schedule changes. If your schedule template changes from day to day, have a daily check-in. However, most people find a weekly alignment is sufficient. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1150))
- External triggers often lead to distraction. Cues in our environment like the pings, dings, and rings from devices, as well as interruptions from other people, frequently take us off track. ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1238))
- External triggers aren’t always harmful. If an external trigger leads us to traction, it serves us. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1241))
- We must ask ourselves: Is this trigger serving me, or am I serving it? Then we can hack back the external triggers that don’t serve us. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1242))
