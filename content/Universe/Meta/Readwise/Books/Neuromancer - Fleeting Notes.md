## Highlights
- Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the fast-forward button. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000O76ON6&location=182))
- Biz here was a constant subliminal hum, and death the accepted punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of grace, the failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000O76ON6&location=186))
- “There is always a point at which the terrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt.
