## Highlights
- That spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous consequences. Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years. This enabled the ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent lions and sharks from wreaking too much havoc. As lions became deadlier, so gazelles evolved to run faster, hyenas to cooperate better, and rhinoceroses to be more bad-tempered. In contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to adjust. Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust. Most top predators of the planet are majestic creatures. Millions of years of dominion have filled them with self-confidence. Sapiens by contrast is more like a banana-republic dictator. Having so recently been one of the underdogs of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. Many historical calamities, from deadly wars to ecological catastrophes, have resulted from this over-hasty jump.

- The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal tract, and the growth of the human brain.

- It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bison. It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=368))
- The new linguistic skills that modern Sapiens acquired about seventy millennia ago enabled them to gossip for hours on end. Reliable information about who could be trusted meant that small bands could expand into larger bands, and Sapiens could develop tighter and more sophisticated types of cooperation.1 ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=374))
- Most likely, both the gossip theory and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid. Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=383))
- It’s relatively easy to agree that only Homo sapiens can speak about things that don’t really exist, and believe six impossible things before breakfast. You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=389))
- Such myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Ants and bees can also work together in huge numbers, but they do so in a very rigid manner and only with close relatives. Wolves and chimpanzees cooperate far more flexibly than ants, but they can do so only with small numbers of other individuals that they know intimately. Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers. That’s why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=396))
- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=409))
- How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=435))
- Churches are rooted in common religious myths. Two Catholics who have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=439))
- Yet none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=444))
- Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=501))
- Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to create states, or churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about things that really exist, such as rivers, trees and lions. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=504))
- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as the United States and Google. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=517))
- This was the key to Sapiens’ success. In a one-on-one brawl, a Neanderthal would probably have beaten a Sapiens. But in a conflict of hundreds, Neanderthals wouldn’t stand a chance. Neanderthals could share information about the whereabouts of lions, but they probably could not tell – and revise – stories about tribal spirits. Without an ability to compose fiction, Neanderthals were unable to cooperate effectively in large numbers, nor could they adapt their social behaviour to rapidly changing challenges. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=553))
- The Cognitive Revolution is accordingly the point when history declared its independence from biology. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=589))
- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=603))
- Age woman came across a tree groaning with figs, the most sensible thing to do was to eat as many of them as she could on the spot, before the local baboon band picked the tree bare. The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=641))
- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=717))
- The human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skilful people in history. ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=775))
- This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions. ([Location 1281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=1281))
- One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=1348))
- History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets. ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=1550))
- Hammurabi and the American Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable principles of justice, such as equality or hierarchy. Yet the only place where such universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, and in the myths they invent and tell one another. These principles have no objective validity. ([Location 1655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=1655))
    - Note: Emphasis on objective validity.
- We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men evolved differently, that they are born with certain mutable characteristics, and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure. ([Location 1684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=1684))
- There is no way out of the imagined order. When we break down our prison walls and run towards freedom, we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison. ([Location 1821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=1821))
- The most important impact of script on human history is precisely this: it has gradually changed the way humans think and view the world. Free association and holistic thought have given way to compartmentalisation and bureaucracy. ([Location 1990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=1990))
- If all that counted were raw physical abilities, Sapiens would have found themselves on a middle rung of the ladder. But their mental and social skills placed them at the top. It is therefore only natural that the chain of power within the species will also be determined by mental and social abilities more than by brute force. ([Location 2347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=2347))
- Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every individual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes equality. The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction.

- Consistency is the playground of dull minds. ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=2469))
- If tensions, conflicts and irresolvable dilemmas are the spice of every culture, a human being who belongs to any particular culture must hold contradictory beliefs and be riven by incompatible values. It’s such an essential feature of any culture that it even has a name: cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is often considered a failure of the human psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset. Had people been unable to hold contradictory beliefs and values, it would probably have been impossible to establish and maintain any human culture. ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=2469))
- Money is thus a universal medium of exchange that enables people to convert almost everything into almost anything else. ([Location 2674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=2674))
- money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised. ([Location 2699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=2699))
- Counterfeiting is not just cheating – it’s a breach of sovereignty, ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=2743))
- an act of subversion against the power, privileges and person of the king. ([Location 2744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=2744))
- The only reason to approach the supreme power of the universe would be to renounce all desires and embrace the bad along with the good – to embrace even defeat, poverty, sickness and death. Thus some Hindus, known as Sadhus or Sannyasis, devote their lives to uniting with Atman, thereby achieving enlightenment. They strive to see the world from the viewpoint of this fundamental principle, to realise that from its eternal perspective all mundane desires and fears are ([Location 3203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=3203))
- The religious wars between Catholics and Protestants that swept Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly notorious. All those involved accepted Christ’s divinity and His gospel of compassion and love. However, they disagreed about the nature of this love. Protestants believed that the divine love is so great that God was incarnated in flesh and allowed Himself to be tortured and crucified, thereby redeeming the original sin and opening the gates of heaven to all those who professed faith in Him. Catholics maintained that faith, while essential, was not enough. To enter heaven, believers had to participate in church rituals and do good deeds. Protestants refused to accept this, arguing that this quid pro quo belittles God’s greatness and love. ([Location 3230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=3230))
- But how do you get the mind to accept things as they are, without craving? To accept sadness as sadness, joy as joy, pain as pain? Gautama developed a set of meditation techniques that train the mind to experience reality as it is, without craving. These practices train the mind to focus all its attention on the question ‘What am I experiencing now?’ rather than on ‘What would I rather be experiencing?’ ([Location 3384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K7ED54M&location=3384))
