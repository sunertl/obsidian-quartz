## Highlights
- ECONOMICS IS HAUNTED by more fallacies than any other study known to man. This is no accident. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=100))
- the special pleading of selfish interests. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=102))
- This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=108))
- is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=110))
- The bad economist sees only what immediately strikes the eye; the good economist also looks beyond. The bad economist sees only the direct consequences of a proposed course; the good economist looks also at the longer and indirect consequences. The bad economist sees only what the effect of a given policy has been or will be on one particular group; the good economist inquires also what the effect of the policy will be on all groups. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=111))
- The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=129))
- But need is not demand. Effective economic demand requires not merely need but corresponding purchasing power. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=197))
- Everything we get, outside of the free gifts of nature, must in some way be paid for. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=274))
- Here we shall have to say simply that all government expenditures must eventually be paid out of the proceeds of taxation; that inflation itself is merely a form, and a particularly vicious form, of taxation. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=278))

- Therefore, for every public job created by the bridge project a private job has been destroyed somewhere else. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=301))
- All credit is debt. Proposals for an increased volume of credit, therefore, are merely another name for proposals for an increased burden of debt. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=396))

- If the government operated by the same strict standards, there would be no good argument for its entering the field at all. Why do precisely what private agencies already do? But the government almost invariably operates by different standards. The whole argument for its entering the lending business, in fact, is that it will make loans to people who could not get them from private lenders. This is only another way of saying that the government lenders will ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=419))

- take risks with other people’s money (the taxpayers’) that private lenders will not take with their own money. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=422))

- A. Government-guaranteed home mortgages, especially when a negligible down payment or no down payment whatever is required, inevitably mean more bad loans than otherwise. They force the general taxpayer to subsidize the bad risks and to defray the losses. They encourage people to “buy” houses that they cannot really afford. They tend eventually to bring about an oversupply of houses as compared with other things. They temporarily overstimulate building, raise the cost of building for everybody (including the buyers of the homes with the guaranteed mortgages), and may mislead the building industry into an eventually costly overexpansion. In brief, in the long run they do not increase overall national production but encourage malinvestment. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=487))

- When the government makes loans or subsidies to business, what it does is to tax successful private business in order to support unsuccessful private business. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XT60KO&location=498))
