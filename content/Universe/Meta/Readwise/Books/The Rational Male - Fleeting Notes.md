## Highlights
- The definition of Power is not financial success, status or influence over others, but the degree to which we have control over our own lives. Subscribing to the soul-mate mythology necessitates that we recognize powerlessness in this arena of our lives. Better I think it would be to foster a healthy understanding that there is no ONE. There are some good Ones and there are some bad Ones, but there is no ONE. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=279))
- In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=344))
- My intent in promoting this Rule is to open the eyes of young men who are already predisposed to devaluing themselves and placing women as the goal of their lives rather than seeing themselves as the prize to be sought after. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=378))
- There’s nothing wrong with backing down from an argument you have with your girlfriend, but there is something wrong when you continually compromise yourself in order to ‘keep the peace’ with the understanding that she’ll withhold intimacy as a result of you holding your ground. That is a power play, also known as a ‘shit test’. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=383))
- Real Power is the degree to which a person has control over their own circumstances. Real Power is the degree to which we actually control the directions of our lives. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=442))
- When we allow our thinking, our personality disorders and our mental schemas, combined with their accompanying behaviors, to determine the course of our decisions, we relinquish real Power. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=444))
- The man who succumbs, by force or by will, to the responsibilities, liabilities and accountabilities that are required of him by society, marriage, commitment, family, fatherhood, career choice, the military, etc. leaves him very little influence over the course of his own life. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=445))
- Women never want full disclosure. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=511))
- Familiarity is anti-seductive. Nothing kills Game, organic passion and libido like comfortable familiarity. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=516))
- The main reason for embracing rejection is that rejection is better than regret. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=712))

- Lastly, experience teaches harsh, but it teaches best. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=716))
- Alpha is mindset, not a demographic. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=809))

- The take home message here is that you are not Alpha because of your achievements, you have your achievements because you are Alpha. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=829))

- A man with options has power, and from these options and this sense of power, a natural sense of confidence will manifest itself. A man without options becomes necessitous and this leads to a lack of confidence and a scarcity mentality. Necessitous men are never free.

- A truly powerful Man jealously guards his most precious resources; his independence and his ability to maneuver. In other words his options and his ability to exercise them. ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1346))

- Regardless, whatever your reasons, women should only ever be a compliment to a man’s life, never the focus of it. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1368))

- It’s called enlightened self-interest; you cannot help anyone until you’ve first helped yourself. ([Location 1374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1374))

- I’m sorry to break this to you, but there is no such thing as a long-distance relationship (LDR). ([Location 1720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1720))

- Men making the personal sacrifices necessary to honor, respect and love her are commonplace. You’re supposed to do those things. You sacrificed your ambitions and potential to provide her with a better life? You were supposed to. You resisted temptation and didn’t cheat on your wife with the hot secretary who was down to fuck and ready to go? You were supposed to. Your responsibilities to maintaining a marriage, a home, your family, etc. are common – they’re expected. They are only appreciated in their absence, in their lack and in their failing.

- This is the totality of the feminine-centric reality. Men only exist to facilitate the feminine reality, and any man who disputes this (or even analyzes its aspects) is by definition not a ‘man’. It just is. ([Location 2361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2361))

- Women love the ‘fixer upper’. “He’d be such a great guy if only he would, _____” or she’ll say, “I’m working on him.” ([Location 2384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2384))

- The unwritten, 49th Law of Power, is denying the utility of power itself, or demonizing its use both moralistically and socially. With the wide dispersion of Game theory this has been the reactionary tact of the feminine imperative; appeal to the deeply conditioned moral, ethical, honorable, virtuous ideals and feminine-specific obligations engrammatically planted in men by a fem-centric society, while redefining the acceptable use of the same Game the feminine imperative demonizes for its own purposes. ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2608))
- At its root level Game is a series of behavioral modifications to life skills based on psychological and sociological principles to facilitate intersexual relations between genders. ([Location 2660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2660))
- Game was a set of behaviors, learned, adapted and modified with the express purpose of bettering a guy’s prospective sexual ‘success’ with the women he had only limited (if any) access to. Game was defined as a series of behavioral skills and techniques observationally experimented with, and developed by the burgeoning pickup artist (PUA) culture of the early 2000′s. ([Location 2662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2662))
- Hypergamy drives women to sustain a prospective man’s interest. ([Location 2780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2780))

- To get more (any?) sex, to retain the frame, to inspire more respect in her, you must disengage from her. ([Location 2802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2802))

- What is needed is incremental reassertion of yourself as the primary AND that her sexual agency, while still welcomed, is not a motivator for your own decisions. ([Location 2804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2804))

- Women want to be with Men who other women want to fuck, and other men want to be. ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2811))

- Nothing is as simultaneously fear inspiring and arousing for women as a Man she suspects is self-aware of his own value. ([Location 2838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2838))

- Communicate with your behavior. Never overtly tell a woman anything. Allow her to come to the conclusions you intend. Her imagination is the best tool in your Game toolbox. Learn how to use it. ([Location 3595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3595))
- Despite what any pop-psychologist has ingrained into you, communication is not the key to success in an LTR. It’s what and how it’s communicated that is. ([Location 3610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3610))
- What do women want? Maximized hypergamy with a man blissfully unaware of hypergamy. The perfect union of emotional investment, parental investment and provisional investment with her hypergamous nature. ([Location 3668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3668))
