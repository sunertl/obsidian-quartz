## Four most common ways to inspire a change in behavior

1. [[Setting clear expectations at the beginning lay the foundation for productive feedback sessions in the future]]
2. [[Task-specific feedback focuses on the what rather than the who, so it feels less personal]]
3. [[Behavioral feedback provides a level of personalization and depth that is missing from task-specific feedback]]
4. [[360 degree feedback creates maximum objectivity]]

## Ways to ensure that feedback can be acted upon

- Making feedback as specific as possible
- Clarify what success looks and feels like
- Suggest next steps

## Other thoughts

- The best way to make your feedback heard is to make the listener feel safe, and to show that you're saying it because you care about them and want them to succeed.
	- When you have critical feedback to share, state your point and follow up with "does this feedback resonate with you? why or why not?"
	- think of sharing feedback per email after the conversation / 1:1
- Critical feedback needs to be delivered directly and dispassionately
	- Plainly say what you perceive the issue to be, what made you feel that way, and how you'd like to work together to resolve the concern
