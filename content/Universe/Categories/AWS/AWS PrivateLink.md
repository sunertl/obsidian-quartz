PrivateLink enables you to **connect to AWS services via private IP addresses in your VPC**.

The **interface endpoints are created directly inside of your VPC**, using elastic network interfaces and IP addresses in your VPCâ€™s subnets. That means that **VPC Security Groups can be used to manage access to the endpoints**
