- Badiou has observed: a brutal state of affairs, profoundly inegalitarian – where all existence is evaluated in terms of money alone – is presented to us as ideal. To justify their conservatism, the partisans of the established order cannot really call it ideal or wonderful. So instead, they have decided to say that all the rest is ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=102))
- horrible. Sure, they say, we may not live in a condition of perfect Goodness. But we’re lucky that we don’t live in a condition of Evil. Our democracy is not perfect. But it’s better than the bloody dictatorships. Capitalism is unjust. But it’s not criminal like Stalinism. We let millions of Africans die of AIDS, but we don’t make racist nationalist declarations like Milosevic.

- are free to continue to participate in capitalist exchange. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=224))
- Capital is an abstract parasite, an insatiable vampire and zombie-maker; but the living flesh it converts into dead labor is ours, and the zombies it makes are us. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=246))
- The fantasy being that western consumerism, far from being intrinsically implicated in systemic global inequalities, could itself solve them. All we have to do is buy the right products. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=255))
- It is more like a pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action.
