## Highlights
- A world is supported by four things….” She held up four big-knuckled fingers. “…the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=646))
- May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger. ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=1425))
- There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man—with human flesh. ([Location 1981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=1981))
- Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.

- Kynes had said: “…the shortening of the way.” In the old tongue, the phrase translated as “Kwisatz Haderach.” ([Location 2513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=2513))
- There is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors. ([Location 2802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=2802))
