## Highlights
- The reality is quite plain: the ‘end of the era of nationalism,’ so long prophesied, is not remotely in sight. Indeed, nation-ness is the most universally legitimate value in the political life of our time. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=162))
- My point of departure is that nationality, or, as one might prefer to put it in view of that word’s multiple significations, nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artefacts of a particular kind. To understand them properly we need to consider carefully how they have come into historical being, in what ways their meanings have changed over time, and why, today, they command such profound emotional legitimacy. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=181))
- In an anthropological spirit, then, I propose the following definition of the nation: it is an imagined political community – and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign. It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=206))
- With a certain ferocity Gellner makes a comparable point when he rules that ‘Nationalism is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness: it invents nations where they do not exist.’ ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=211))
- In fact, all communities larger than primordial villages of face-to-face contact (and perhaps even these) are imagined. Communities are to be distinguished, not by their falsity/genuineness, but by the style in which they are imagined. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=216))
- The nation is imagined as limited because even the largest of them, encompassing perhaps a billion living human beings, has finite, if elastic, boundaries, beyond which lie other nations. No nation imagines itself coterminous with mankind. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=223))
- It is imagined as sovereign because the concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchical dynastic realm. Coming to maturity at a stage of human history when even the most devout adherents of any universal religion were inescapably confronted with the living pluralism of such religions, and the allomorphism between each faith’s ontological claims and territorial stretch, nations dream of being free, and, if under God, directly so. The gage and emblem of this freedom is the sovereign state. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=227))
- Finally, it is imagined as a community, because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=231))
- What I am proposing is that nationalism has to be understood by aligning it, not with self-consciously held political ideologies, but with the large cultural systems that preceded it, out of which – as well as against which – it came into being. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=308))
- For present purposes, the two relevant cultural systems are the religious community and the dynastic realm. For both of these, in their heydays, were taken-for-granted frames of reference, very much as nationality is today. It is therefore essential to consider what gave these cultural systems their self-evident plausibility, and at the same time to underline certain key elements in their decomposition.

- These print-languages laid the bases for national consciousnesses in three distinct ways. First and foremost, they created unified fields of exchange and communication below Latin and above the spoken vernaculars. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=943))
- Second, print-capitalism gave a new fixity to language, which in the long run helped to build that image of antiquity so central to the subjective idea of the nation. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=949))
- Third, print-capitalism created languages-of-power of a kind different from the older administrative vernaculars. ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=956))
- We can summarize the conclusions to be drawn from the argument thus far by saying that the convergence of capitalism and print technology on the fatal diversity of human language created the possibility of a new form of imagined community, which in its basic morphology set the stage for the modern nation. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=973))
- To see how administrative units could, over time, come to be conceived as fatherlands, not merely in the Americas but in other parts of the world, one has to look at the ways in which administrative organizations create meaning. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=1122))
- What were the characteristics of the first American newspapers, North or South? They began essentially as appendages of the market. Early gazettes contained – aside from news about the metropole – commercial news (when ships would arrive and depart, what prices were current for what commodities in what ports), as well as colonial political appointments, marriages of the wealthy, and so forth. In other words, what brought together, on the same page, this marriage with that ship, this price with that bishop, was the very structure of the colonial administration and market-system itself. In this way, the newspaper of Caracas quite naturally, and even apolitically, created an imagined community among a specific assemblage of fellow-readers, to whom these ships, brides, bishops and prices belonged. In time, of course, it was only to be expected that political elements would enter in. ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=1245))
- What I am proposing is that neither economic interest, Liberalism, nor Enlightenment could, or did, create in themselves the kind, or shape, of imagined community to be defended from these regimes’ depredations; to put it another way, none provided the framework of a new consciousness – the scarcely-seen periphery of its vision – as opposed to centre-field objects of its admiration or disgust.53 In accomplishing this specific task, pilgrim creole functionaries and provincial creole printmen played the decisive historic role. 1 ([Location 1289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=1289))
- Thus in world-historical terms bourgeoisies were the first classes to achieve solidarities on an essentially imagined basis. But in a nineteenth-century Europe in which Latin had been defeated by vernacular print-capitalism for something like two centuries, these solidarities had an outermost stretch limited by vernacular legibilities. To put it another way, one can sleep with anyone, but one can only read some people’s words. ([Location 1567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=1567))
- In conclusion, then it has been argued that from about the middle of the nineteenth century there developed what Seton-Watson terms ‘official nationalisms’ inside Europe. These nationalisms were historically ‘impossible’ until after the appearance of popular linguistic-nationalisms, for, at bottom, they were responses by power-groups – primarily, but not exclusively, dynastic and aristocratic – threatened with exclusion from, or marginalization in, popular imagined communities.
