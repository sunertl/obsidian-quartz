- Summary: Media multitasking, engaging with various digital media simultaneously, has been shown to impair attention in young adults, affecting their ability to recall specific experiences. A study using brain activity measurements found that higher media multitasking was linked to attention lapses and reduced memory. The research suggests that sustained attention plays a role in the relationship between heavy media multitasking and memory issues, highlighting the importance of being mindful of attentiveness in a digital age where distractions are abundant. Future studies aim to explore interventions that could enhance attention and memory in individuals prone to digital distractions.

## Highlights
- A new study published today in *Nature* supports the concern. The research suggests that “media multitasking”—or engaging with multiple forms of digital or screen-based media simultaneously, whether they are television, texting or Instagram—may [impair attention in young adults](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2870-z), worsening their ability to later recall specific situations or experiences ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrrck4dqax2e3pt0th5eyzc8))
- Previous work had shown a connection between media multitasking and poorer episodic memory. The new findings offer clues as to why this might be the case. “We found evidence that one’s ability to sustain attention helps to explain the relationship between heavier media multitasking and worse memory,” says the paper’s lead author Kevin Madore, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychology at Stanford University. “Individuals who are heavier media multitaskers may also show worse memory because they have lower sustained attention ability.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrrcp7tp5442tz8vhzgqnx14))
- Madore feels the new study stresses the need to be mindful of how we engage with media. “I think our data point to the importance of being consciously aware of attentiveness,” he says, whether that awareness means resisting media multitasking during school lectures or work Zoom sessions or making sure not to idly flip through your Facebook feed while half watching the new *Borat* movie.
