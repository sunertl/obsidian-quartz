## Highlights
- The great danger is that we give in to feelings of boredom, impatience, fear, and confusion. We stop observing and learning. The process comes to a halt. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U1U2IU&location=243))
- You will unconsciously lower your sights as to what you can accomplish in life. This can diminish your levels of effort and discipline below the point of effectiveness. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U1U2IU&location=464))
- First, you must see your attempt at attaining mastery as something extremely necessary and positive. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U1U2IU&location=472))
- This is not mastery for the purpose of dominating nature or other people, but for determining our fate. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U1U2IU&location=476))
- You are setting an example of what can be achieved as a Master in the modern world. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U1U2IU&location=477))
- Second, you must convince yourself of the following: people get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve through their actions in life. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U1U2IU&location=479))
- People who are passive create a mental landscape that is rather barren. Because of their limited experiences and action, all kinds of connections in the brain die off from lack of use. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U1U2IU&location=484))
