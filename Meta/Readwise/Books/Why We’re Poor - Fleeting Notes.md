## Highlights
- accuracy. The dollar is not a reliable measuring stick of price, especially over a long period of time. Remember that our currency can be created in quantities by which inflation is most always the result, and the target. Inflation, especially over a lifetime, eats away the value of the currency and takes away your purchasing power. Wage inflation and incomes do not, and have not, kept up with price inflation, resulting in ever greater proportions of salaries devoted to these purchases an diverted away from savings and investment. Think of your own family’s budget, what percent of your family income do you spend on just groceries alone? College education? Healthcare? A college education in the 1970s used to cost approximately 7% of the median income, as of 2015 it costs 25%.10 From a cost of $7.00 out of every $100.00 to $25.00 out of every $100.00 in less than fifty years, how can this be?

- of loans and borrowing, so that individuals can only attempt to maintain a consistent quality of life by borrowing on top of their stagnant wages. Americans have become addicted, reliant, and enslaved to their debts. This is why we’re poor. Massive spending and massive borrowing, as opposed to saving and investing. Debt destroys wealth, saving and investment creates it. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076MMJ7F4&location=260))
- As a debtor, the federal government prefers a steady, slow rate of inflation, or seignorage: the right of kings or sovereigns to dilute the supply of money held by the public, lowering its value, as a transfer to its own spending and discount to its debt.

- The same grim picture presented itself in the real estate and mortgage loan market not long ago. The now infamous housing boom and bust of the mid 2000s, depicted brilliantly in films like“The Big Short,” was fueled by the same noxious brew of low interest rates, government guarantees, dangerously low lending standards (unqualified borrowers), and bubble-mesmerized investors chasing rising assets and any yield in a low interest rate environment, courtesy of the Federal Reserve. A confluence of bad incentives came together, due to the availability of huge sums of essentially “free (credit) money,” to bid up housing prices. Everyone got in on it. Rating agencies, corrupted by bad incentives, colluded with banks in offloading credit risk to naïve investors, including pension funds, through the sales chicanery of sharp brokers, pitching AAA rated mortgage backed securities. The government came in when the party was over to bail out the lenders, while the home owners and investors lost it all.

- Bear in mind that dollars and currency notes are a liability of the government, and are not assets as such. They don’t yield anything, and there is no guarantee of their long term value. Wealth is a function of decisions, the collection of decisions you make. Careful study and practical planning make it that much more likely that you’ll maintain a comfortable, secure standard if living and pass on both wealth and knowledge to your children, which is itself the best source of wealth they can have.
